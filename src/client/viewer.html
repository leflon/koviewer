				<h1>South Korea administrative divisions</h1>
				<h2>Upper-level local autonomy (시도)</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>시도</strong> (<em>Sido</em>) represents the highest tier of local government in South
					Korea, functioning as the primary administrative division below the central government. This level
					possesses significant autonomy and is legally distinct as a broad-scale regional authority.
					Administratively, it is responsible for handling affairs that span wide geographic areas, such as
					regional transportation planning, environmental conservation, and high-level education policies.
					Governance is democratic; residents directly elect the head of the local government and members of
					the local council every four years. The administrative center is usually a large complex, and
					citizens typically visit here only for major regulatory issues, passport services (though often
					delegated), or region-wide complaints, as day-to-day affairs are handled at lower levels.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_South_Korea"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						>도 (<em>Do</em>)</a
					>
				</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>도</strong> (<em>Do</em>) refers to a Province, which is the traditional regional unit
					covering large geographic territories with a mix of urban and rural populations. There are 9 of
					them, including 3 <em>Special self-governing provinces.&nbsp;</em>Legally, a Province is led by a
					Governor (<a
						href="https://krdict.korean.go.kr/eng/dicMarinerSearch/search?mainSearchWord=도지사"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						><em>Dojisa</em></a
					>) who is elected by popular vote, alongside a Provincial Council that acts as the legislative
					check. Administratively, the provincial government manages the coordination between the central
					government and the smaller cities or counties within its jurisdiction. It focuses on balanced
					regional development, agriculture, and infrastructure that connects its various sub-divisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The South Korean administrative system also maintains a symbolic claim over northern territory
					through the
					<strong>이북5도</strong> (<em>Ibuk-5-do</em>), or the Five Northern Provinces. Managed by the
					<a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_the_Five_Northern_Korean_Provinces"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>
						<strong>이북5도위원회</strong> (<em>Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces</em>) </a
					>, these entities are legally defined by the
					<a
						href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/일제강점기의_행정_구역#도(道)"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						>administrative boundaries of 1945 (ko)</a
					>, strictly ignoring changes made by the North Korean regime. As the South possesses no de facto
					control over this land, the honorary governors are formally appointed by the President of the
					Republic of Korea and their role is not territorial governance. Instead, their administrative
					mandate is centered on supporting the community of displaced families and North Korean defectors
					currently residing in the South, preserving their regional cultural heritage, and maintaining the
					legal framework for potential future reunification.
				</p>
				<h3>
					<a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_provincial-level_cities_of_South_Korea"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						>시 (<em>Si</em>)</a
					>
				</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>시</strong> (<em>Si</em>) at this level refers to Special Cities, Metropolitan Cities, or
					Special Self-Governing Cities, which are administratively equivalent to a Province but are
					distinctively urban. These entities, such as Seoul or Busan, are led by a Mayor (<a
						href="https://krdict.korean.go.kr/eng/dicMarinerSearch/search?mainSearchWord=시장"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						><em>Sijang</em></a
					>) rather than a Governor, but they possess the same legal standing and autonomy as a Province. They
					manage high-density urban planning, public transit systems like subways, and city-wide zoning.
					Residents elect the Mayor and City Council members directly, and the administration is tailored to
					the complexities of managing massive metropolitan populations independent of a surrounding province.
				</p>
				<h2>Lower-level local autonomy (시군구)</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>시군구</strong> (<em>Sigungu</em>) serves as the basic local government unit and is the tier
					where most direct interaction between the government and the people occurs. Legally, this level has
					its own autonomous status (except for non-autonomous districts in certain cities) with independent
					budgets and powers delegated by the upper <em>Sido</em> level. Administratively, these units are
					responsible for the majority of civil registrations, such as birth and marriage certificates, local
					tax collection, land registration, and sanitation. Residents generally feel a stronger connection to
					this level of government for daily needs.
				</p>
				<h3>시 (<em>Si</em>)</h3>
				<p>
					<a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_South_Korea"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						><strong>시</strong> (<em>Si</em>)</a
					>
					at this tier is a specific administrative designation for a City that has a population typically
					over 50,000 and an urbanized structure, situated within a Province. It is led by an elected Mayor
					and monitored by a City Council. Legally, it operates independently from the county system and
					manages its own urban development, water supply, and local economic promotion. If the population
					exceeds 500,000, it may receive additional administrative powers similar to a metropolitan city,
					allowing it to manage its own districts, though it remains under the provincial jurisdiction.
				</p>
				<h3>군 (<em>Gun</em>)</h3>
				<p>
					<a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_(administrative_division)"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						><strong>군</strong> (<em>Gun</em>)</a
					>
					is a County, predominantly finding its place in rural areas or less urbanized regions within a
					Province or sometimes within a Metropolitan City. It is governed by an elected County Governor (<a
						href="https://krdict.korean.go.kr/eng/dicMarinerSearch/search?mainSearchWord=군수"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						><em>Gunsu</em></a
					>) and a County Council. Administratively, the focus here is heavily tilted toward agriculture,
					forestry, and rural development support. The population density is lower than in a <em>Si</em>, and
					the administrative services often include substantial support for farming communities and preserving
					local traditions and landscapes.
				</p>
				<h3>구 (<em>Gu</em>)</h3>
				<p>
					<a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_districts_in_South_Korea"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						><strong>구</strong> (<em>Gu</em>)</a
					>
					is a District found strictly within larger cities. There is a critical legal distinction here: in
					Special or Metropolitan Cities (like Seoul), these are &quot;Autonomous Districts&quot;
					(<em>Jachigu</em>) where residents elect a District Mayor (<a
						href="https://krdict.korean.go.kr/eng/dicMarinerSearch/search?mainSearchWord=구청"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						><em>Gucheong</em></a
					><a
						href="https://krdict.korean.go.kr/eng/dicMarinerSearch/search?mainSearchWord=장#:~:text=head"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						><em>jang</em></a
					>) and Council, possessing their own taxation powers and local autonomy. However, in large regular
					Cities, these are &quot;Administrative Districts&quot; (<em>Ilbangu</em>) which are merely
					non-autonomous branches of the city government used to improve administrative efficiency. In these
					cases, the head is an appointed official, not elected, and there is no district council. Residents
					visit the District Office for passport applications, parking permits, and social welfare
					registration.
				</p>
				<h2>Subordinate Administrative Level (읍면동)</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>읍면동</strong> (<em>Eupmyeondong</em>) acts as the supplementary administrative unit
					comprising the sub-divisions of the <em>Sigungu</em>. This level is strictly administrative and
					legally non-autonomous, meaning there are no local elections held for these positions. The heads of
					these divisions are career civil servants appointed by the Mayor or County Governor. The primary
					function of this level is to act as the terminal administrative capillary, delivering welfare
					benefits, handling resident registration (move-in reports), and issuing various civil documents
					directly to the public.
				</p>
				<h3>읍 (<em>Eup</em>)</h3>
				<p>
					<a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eup_(administrative_division)"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						><strong>읍</strong> (<em>Eup</em>)</a
					>
					is a Town division, typically serving as the center of commerce and population within a rural County
					(<em>Gun</em>) or a localized urban center within a mixed City. To be designated as an <em>Eup</em>,
					the area usually needs a population of at least 20,000 and a distinct urbanized street grid.
					Administratively, the <em>Eup</em> office handles tasks similar to the <em>Myeon</em> but on a
					slightly larger scale due to the higher population density, often managing waste disposal
					coordination and local public facility maintenance.
				</p>
				<h3>면 (<em>Myeon</em>)</h3>
				<p>
					<a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myeon_(administrative_division)"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						><strong>면</strong> (<em>Myeon</em>)</a
					>
					is a Township, representing the rural countryside within a County or City. It typically has a lower
					population density than an <em>Eup</em> and is composed primarily of farming or fishing communities.
					The <em>Myeon</em> office serves as the administrative hub for a wide geographic area of scattered
					villages. The appointed Head of <em>Myeon</em> focuses on agricultural support, disaster prevention
					in rural areas (like flood control), and coordinating social services for elderly residents who make
					up a large portion of the demographic.
				</p>
				<h3>동 (<em>Dong</em>)</h3>
				<p>
					<a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dong_(administrative_division)"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						><strong>동</strong> (<em>Dong</em>)</a
					>
					is a Neighborhood division found in urban Districts (<em>Gu</em>) or Cities (<em>Si</em>). It is the
					smallest urban administrative unit where the &quot;Community Service Center&quot; (often called the
					Happy Community Center) is located. This is the most frequented government office for urban
					residents to register residency, obtain seal certificates
				</p>
				<h2>Village level (리)</h2>
				<p>
					<a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ri_(administrative_division)"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						><strong>리</strong> (<em>Ri</em>)</a
					>
					is the Village unit, serving as the smallest subdivision of rural towns (<em>Eup</em>) and townships
					(<em>Myeon</em>). Unlike the urban <em>Dong</em>, the <em>Ri</em> is a natural village settlement.
					While not a fully autonomous level of government, it has a unique administrative role where the
					Village Head (<em>Ijang</em>) acts as a liaison. The <em>Ijang</em> is typically selected by the
					villagers (often via a village meeting or consensus) and formally appointed by the <em>Eup</em>/<em
						>Myeon</em
					>
					head. There is no government office building for a <em>Ri</em>; instead, the focus is on the
					&quot;Village Hall&quot; (<a
						href="https://krdict.korean.go.kr/eng/dicMarinerSearch/search?mainSearchWord=마을"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						><em>Maeul</em></a
					><em>&nbsp;</em
					><a
						href="https://krdict.korean.go.kr/eng/dicMarinerSearch/search?mainSearchWord=회관"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						><em>Hoegwan</em></a
					>), which acts as a communal gathering space for seniors and a venue for village meetings regarding
					agricultural cooperation or community events.
